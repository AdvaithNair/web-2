            The mission of FTC 12599 and the rest of Spark Technology Education is to compete in robotics competitions like
            FIRST and to have more people join FIRST, which we have plenty of expenditures for. Encouraging people to the
            STEM community is a great concept, as it has tremendous impacts towards the future of the entire world.

          <p>
            It’s way more than building robots. FIRST Tech Challenge teams (10+ members, grades 7-12) are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.

          <p>
            In this climate of economic uncertainty, America is once again turning to innovation as the way to ensure a prosperous future.

            Yet innovation remains tightly coupled with Science, Technology, Engineering and Math – the STEM subjects. Art + Design are poised to transform our economy in the 21st century just as science and technology did in the last century.

            We need to add Art + Design to the equation — to transform STEM into STEAM.

          <p>
            El Tigre is a robot created by us. We've used it in many competitions and have demonstrated it to several people who are interested abour robotics and STEAM. We have also helped various nonprofits such as Spark Technology Education, Ignited Tech, and Education for Chinese Orphans.

          <p>
            We've trained several kids across Oregon. Most of these kids learn STEAM concepts and about FIRST. One example is William Walker Elementary School, where we've taught over 22 students how to do FTC.
